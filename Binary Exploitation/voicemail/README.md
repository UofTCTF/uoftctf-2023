Challenge Description: 

Our informants have discovered the super spy Agent 1337's voicemail service. Rumor has it that Agent 1337 has cleverly built a backdoor into it, which provides access to top secret data! Our informants have provided you with the binary, as well as the libc version used by the service. Your mission is to find the backdoor and get those secrets!

Good luck!
