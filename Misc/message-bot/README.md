Title: Message Bot

Description: Hereâ€™s a bot I made using discord.py. It has some basic 
capabilities, including adding a message to a spreadsheet and doing math. 
The last time I released this, my friends deleted all my files using the 
/math command. This time I think the bot is secure!

Hint: flag.txt may hold something interesting.
